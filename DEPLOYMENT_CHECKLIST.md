## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Build Failures**: Check Render logs, verify package.json dependencies
**Database Issues**: Verify Atlas connection string and network access
**CORS Errors**: Check FRONTEND_URL environment variable
**API Not Found**: Verify VITE_API_URL environment variable
**Pipeline Failures**: Check GitHub Actions logs, verify workflow syntax
**Auto-Deploy Issues**: Ensure GitHub-Render connection is active
